Things I am working on:

Writing cleaner code:
Classes should only contain 1 conceptual idea!
If you are explaining what a class does, you should be able to wrap it up into one idea without an "and".
For example:
I split up our config file from into 3 different files.
Config file getter/setter + error correction + value verification.

Functions should only do one thing, and it should do it well.
The ideal function takes in one value and outputs one value.
If it takes in over 3 values, it is probably doing more than one thing.
